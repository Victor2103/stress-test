## Objective

The aim of this tutorial is to benchmarking your application. Imagine you create your application and you want to know how many GPU you will need to deploy it. How many users will use your API ? To do this, there are several applications who simulate the number of users and the number of requests you want to simulate. But let's dive a little deeper. We will use here a simple framework from python named locust. This framework is really easy to install if you have pip on your machine. Of course, there lots of others applications to stress test your apps. I can name [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey). This app requires to use a virtual machine so is a little more complicated to install compared to locust. You can also use [k6](https://k6.io/docs/test-types/stress-testing/). This framework is a little more complicated to install but can be use without python if you don't like the language. Lots of apps have been created to stress test your applications. Now, let's try to test our API. In this use case, the api is a spam classifier. If you're interested with this API, please check this [tutorial](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/publiccloud/ai/deploy/tuto-fastapi-spam-classifier/). Lots of others API are available on the `OVH portfolio` from AI deploy. You can found them [here](https://docs.ovh.com/fr/publiccloud/ai/deploy/apps-portfolio/). But it is not the purpose of the tutorial because you must test your API ! 

**Requirements**

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB);
- A Public Cloud project created;
- An API running in AI Deploy on your public cloud project. 

## Instructions


### Try our API

Ok let's test our API with a simple curl command. To do this, we will do a simple curl command in a terminal. Here is the command : 
```console 
curl -s -X POST \ 
"<api_url>/spam_detection_path \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"message":"This is a test from my machine"}' | jq
```

Here are a few explanations of the lines : 
- In the first line, we specify that we will use a post method. 
- We specify the url where the post request will be executed. The `api_url` is the url of your api. It should look something like this : `https://baac2c13-2e69-4d0f-ae6b-dg9eff9be513.app.gra.ai.cloud.ovh.net/`. 
- We put the token to access our API. We specify it in the header of the request. 
- We specify that our body in in a json format.
- We put in our body the message we want to send to the spam classifier. In your case, the body could be different because it depends of the API. And we hope the chatbot will send us the probability of each response. The last `| jq` instruction permits to have a good display of the result in the terminal. 

Now, that we test our API, let's try to stress test it. We will simply simulate several curl command. With the tool locust, we can simulate several users and define a number of calls to the API we want per minute. This can be easily done with the locust's interface. But before use this interface, we need to launch the locust and configure the tool. This can be easily done with python. Let's do this !

### Configure Locust to run the tests

To configure the software, you need to create a file named `locustfile.py`. In this file, you can put the path where you want to make your request, the headers of your request, the type of the request (POST, GET, etc) and the body if you want to add a body to the request. For my API, the locust file will be something like this : 
```python
# Import the dependecies of locust
from locust import HttpUser, task
# Import general library from python
import os
import random
# Import lorem ipsum library to generate some text
from lorem_text import lorem
# Import dotenv to load the environments variables
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Create a table with some lorem ipsum texts
messages = []

# Add 1000 random texts of 10 paragraphs each (simulate 1000 emails)
for i in range(1000):
    messages.append(lorem.paragraphs(10))

# Define the headers of the request
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('TOKEN')}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}


class HelloWorldUser(HttpUser):
    # Definition of the first path where we do our post request
    @task
    def hello_world(self):
        # Define the body with the email choose randomly from the tab of all the emails
        body = {"message": random.choice(messages)}
        # Do the post request on the spam detection path
        self.client.post("/spam_detection_path",
                         headers=headers, json=body)
```

In this file, you have to change the path, the headers and the body because there are parameters who change from API to API. Once your locustfile is ready, you need to launch the interface locust. The best way to create this is to launch a container with your locust app. You can launch it locally with docker or directly on AI Deploy. [Here](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/ai/deploy/build-use-streamlit-image/) is an example of how to launch an app on AI Deploy. Below is how looks like your `requirements.txt` file if you want to use docker to launch locust. 
```
Brotli==1.0.9
certifi==2022.12.7
charset-normalizer==3.1.0
click==8.1.3
ConfigArgParse==1.5.3
Flask==2.2.3
Flask-BasicAuth==0.2.0
Flask-Cors==3.0.10
gevent==22.10.2
geventhttpclient==2.0.8
greenlet==2.0.2
idna==3.4
importlib-metadata==6.0.0
itsdangerous==2.1.2
Jinja2==3.1.2
locust==2.15.0
lorem-text==2.1
MarkupSafe==2.1.2
msgpack==1.0.4
psutil==5.9.4
python-dotenv==1.0.0
pyzmq==25.0.0
requests==2.28.2
roundrobin==0.0.4
six==1.16.0
typing_extensions==4.5.0
urllib3==1.26.14
Werkzeug==2.2.3
zipp==3.15.0
zope.event==4.6
zope.interface==5.5.2
```

And the dockerfile should be somethink like this : 
```
FROM python:3.8

WORKDIR /workspace
ADD . /workspace

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt



RUN chown -R 42420:42420 /workspace
ENV HOME=/workspace

EXPOSE 8089

CMD locust
```

Now, I have my app running on OVHcloud. Let's simulate some users ! 

You can go on the url of your locust app and you should see somethink like this : 
![image](images/locust.png){.thumbnail}

Ok, now let's run our test to test our API. For my example, I will fill 1000 users of the API with 100 users who make a call per minute. And I will simulate this for a duration of 10m. Let's run and wait. Tic, Tac, the results will be in the next part !
